# AdventureWorks Assignment

## Notes
I have a mac as my personal computer so I wanted to avoide setting up a new version of windows just to install SQLServer. I also wanted to avoid spinning up a whole new RDS server just to get the AdventureWorks data. Instead, I decided to setup an Athena database using S3 as the staging ground for the AdventureWorks data.

## Step 1
Firstly, I cloned the git repository from SQLServer and found the correct .csv files to import into Athena

git clone git@github.com:stumptowndoug/sql-server-samples.git
